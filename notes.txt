OSI Review
========================
Layer 1 - Physical - wires,hub,connectors
Layer 2 - Datalink - switch, bridge, 
MPLS,IPSEC 
Layer 3 - Network - router, mls switch, layer 3 sw| NAT
IPSEC
Layer 4 - Transport - PAT
SSL
Layer 5 - Session - keep alives
Layer 6 - Presentation - compression
Layer 7 - Application - browser..etc    Ironport

Firewalls/Load balancers/IPS span transport-application
Technially ICMP is layer 3 but rides on IP(layer 4)
GRE - Generic routing encapsulation
How to remember - Please do not throw sausage pizza away

Switches - 	Flood broadcast, unknown unicast, multicast
		Learn Source MAC addresses

IOS Commands
========================
Ask yourself two questions - what mode am i in?  is there a subcommand

copy run start - copies running config to startup config

know login local vs login


Base Config Template
+++++++++++++++++++++

_________

service password enc - encrypts all passwords
hostname somethinguseful
ip domain name anystring
enable password garbage
enable secret rax123
username rack priv 15 pass rax123  - used by login local
no ip domain lookup -

line con 0
logging syncronous - enables automatic CTRL-R to prevent log messages from overwriting command line
exec-timeout 27
hist size 200

login          - no username authenticated

line vty 0 4    -  for remote in band connections  allows 5 connections (0-4)
logging syncronous 
exec timeout 27

login local   - reference the local user account db
transport input ssh

line vty 5 15
login  - locks out additional connections

shut/no shut  - shutdown unused ports
descriptions on all interfaces
*switchport mode access - says dont be a trunk link
*switchport access VLAN # - assigns a vlan to a port inside interface subconfig
*switchport no negotiate - not work with dynamic trunking protocal
***spanning-tree portfast default -BPDU guard  - global config mode for all ports
no cdp run - can be done global   cisco discovery protocol - cisco ip phones often require CDP
no cdp enable - done on the interface  - only turn on when used - turn on the interface first, then global

Module 2 Notes
==========================

Found in IPv4 Service type field
ToS - type of service
QoS - quality of service

DSCP - differentiated services code point

Fragmentation occurs when packet is bigger than MTU of device.  Fragmentation in general is viewed as bad.  Can be exploited to insert bad fragments into good ones
TTL is a hop count - layer 3 hops, not time
Protocol - 6 is tcp, 17 is udp

TCP
+++++++++

TCP has 3-way handshake
1. A sends SYN + seed value (example 100)
2. B sends SYN + seed value (500) and ACK number 101
3. A sends ACK (501)
4. Open tcp connection/session

A -> SYN(100)
B -> SYN(500) ACK(101)
A -> ACK(501)

To finish
FIN/RST/TIMEOUT

Source ports are typically in the ephemeral range (typically about 1024)  Find high end of the range

DNS uses TCP for zone transfers and UDP for name resolution


ARP resolves layer 3 to layer 2 addresses, usually for a host communicating out
MAC ADD table  - L2 -> L1  normally for frames passing through
ROUTE Table - L3 -> L1  normally for frames passing through

Understand the source/destination MACs of routers vs switches

VLANS
====================
Works at layer 2

802.1q

Configurable VLAN IDs are 1-4094
VLANS greater than 1023 are called extended VLANs

Native VLAN - is the only untagged vlan on 802.1q trunks - is configurable, not always vlan 1.  
Native vlans must match on both sides of trunk or native vlan mismatch will occur
On most equipment vlans are stored in vlan.dat in flash

VLANs allow for logical grouping of physical ports across one or more switches
VLAN is identified by a shim head that contains VLAN ID # in ethernet frames

In IOS switchport mode access says send plain ethernet (untagged)
	- switchport mode trunk says tag all frames between endpoints(switches) not all uplinks are trunks
Cisco proprietary version of vlans - ISL (depricated) used 1-1005 for ID #s

Sending to hypervisors may have trunk mode enabled for vSwitch vlans

=============
Module 4
=============

Almost always a unique vlan is assigned to a subnet so we can route between

Operational Mode: static access = access mode

In order for a switch to pass through a vlan, the vlan must exist on the switch
