Exam Prep Methods
=====================================
1.  Go to class/RTFM - intial exposure
2.  "Practice the test" 
        -  do not look at answers - use to find weaknesses
		-  timed   30min/50 questions
		-  quiet/uninterrupted time
3.  Write out by hand every missed question
4.  Look up in the official courseware and take hand written notes for every missed question
5.  Repeat until you can get 95% on practice exams



Routers
=================
#1 rule of the routing table - longest prefix match
Routers route using the routing table
Dynamic routing protocols "gossip"/advertise about available networks
Routers fail closed - if no match found it drops unless a 0.0.0.0/0 (default route) is specified.
Default routes have zero length masks

Convergence time - the time it takes for all the routers to know all the paths

How a routing table is built:
  Static Sources
    -  physically connected interfaces  			admin dist of 0
    -  static routes   								admin dist of 1
  Dynamic 
    -  EIGRP  AD 90
	-  OSFP   AD 110
	-  ISIS   AD 115
	-  RIP    AD 120
	-  BGP 
	     -  iBGP  AD 200 (internal)
		 -  eBGP  AD 20  (external)
	Routes are "ranked" by administrative distance

	By default RIP,OSPF, and EIGRP will all load balance across up to 4 equal cost paths
	Routing table allows for up to 16 equal cost paths for the same network
	
	DRP Categories
	  -  Distance vector - typically has slow convergence and frequent advertisements.  Will route by rumor
	    -  RIP v2
		
	  -  Link State - typically has fast convergence.  wants to know all the paths
	    -  OSPF - builds a topology database

EIGRP uses dual algorithm 

Routing protocol metrics are not the same as administrative distance
EIGRP has a composite metric - look up metric
not all routing protocols evaluate metrics the same way.  each algorithm is unique to each protocol.
Metrics are cumulative throughout network.  ie. if i am one hop away, next is 2 hops away


Configuring routers:
  all router interfaces out of the box start out down, switch ports are on out the box.
  
  to create a static route
  ip route NETID MASK NEXTHOPIP
  
  
  OSPF
  ======
  Link state protocol
  Has topology db using spf calculations
  uses mcast to communicate
  224.0.0.5  all OSPF routers
  224.0.0.6  all designated router/ designated backup routers  #double check this
  OSPFs metric is called Cost  default is REF Bandwidth over INT Bandwith, can be manually set
  Admin Distance is 110
  Forms neighbor relationship with other routers on bootup
    -  need to have same area ID
	-  same hello and dead intervals
	-  same authentication
	-  same subnet mask
	-  Link state advertisements (LSA) 
	
  Must always have an area 0.  Called backbone area or transit

		
To configure OSPF
remove static routes
(config)#no ip route .......
(config)#router ospf 9  (9 is Process ID)
(config-router)#router-id 6.6.6.6  (loopback ip)
(config-router)#net 192.6.111.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
(config-router)#net 192.16.222.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
(config-router)#net 6.6.6.6 0.0.0.0 area 0
(config-router)#net 10.10.10.8 0.0.0.3 area 0
(config-router)#passive-int g0/0
(config-router)#passive-int g0/1
(config-router)#maximum-paths 1
ctrl-z
show ip protocols


		
		
		
An autonomous system is a collection of networks within a common administrative domain

PASSWORD Recovery
Config Register value 0x2102 is normal boot behaviour
0x2142 says ignore startup config
When booting, in first few seconds issue a <break> to drop into rommon mode
  rommon>confreg 0x2142
  rommon>reset
  go into global config mode
  (config)#config-register 0x2102
  fix password issues
